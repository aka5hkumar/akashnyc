        <h2>ResoDrill<h2>
          <p>The purpose of this project was to create a product to
             help doctors detect resonance frequencies during specific surgeries.
             A proof of concept was needed for the school to file a provisional patent over the technology.
              There was another team in Ireland working on the same problem.
              A a result most time was spent developing a property solution with various
              sensors to analyze any data we procured was made and analysis was done after
              the fact in Matlab. Testing was done in collaboration with the
              Albert Einstein College of Medicine.</p>
        <h2>Solar Light</h2>
        <p>My roommate and I were approached to create a dead simple and cheap solution to help the UN distribute solar powered lanterns in Africa. Existing solutions were too expensive, too heavy, and too over engineered, and we were tasked with creating
          a working prototype, at which point the project was taken out of our hands. While we met the milestones presented to us, in the end manufacturing proved too cumbersome and we were not able to bring the product to fruition. </p>

          <h2>Uber Movement</h2>
          <p>Uber has a great website to help cities and people see how congested various cities are.
             However, this data is only available on the website. As a final project,
              I made an API to make this data accessible to people outside of the private
               beta and outside of the website. It worked really well until Uber blocked my account.</p>
          <h2>Rocket Telemetry</h2>
          <p>My roommate is an Aerospace Engineer
            and for his final project he made a rocket.
            I made the data tracking software for it from scratch.
             It brought together GPS, Accelerometer,
             and camera data in a way that was as redundant as possible. </p>
          <h2>Video Slicing</h2>
          <p>I project done for Mango Concepts,
            I created and helped design a product that allowed people
            to type in whatever phrase they wanted and have either presidential
            candidate say whatever you typed based on all of their speeches. <p>
