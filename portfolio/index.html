        <h3> Below are a few of the best
          examples of what I have created. I do more than design though.
          All of these projects have more to them than just the design.
          Whether it was creating the backend API to produce the data or
          animating the graphics or even laser cutting what I designed to
          fabracate something real, these projects started as designs
           but have all grown into much more.<br>

          <p>Built from scratch, this site is one of my longest running projects. From the animations to the layouts, everything was done entirely by me with no templates. It is built using little more than just bootstrap 4 and a lot of html.</p>

        <p>My logo is a constant work in progress. When trying to come up with the initial concept I realized that whatever I created had to work across the many mediums that I work with. It doesnâ€™t matter if my logo is appearing, fully animated, at the
          end of a video or etched onto a circuit board, It needs to be truly iconic. In order to best achieve this I use simple lines. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first iteration (top left) was curvy. Thanks to certain TV shows I quickly grew tired of this logo. I went back to the drawing board and decided to work from the tensegrity triangle, a shape I was familiar with from creating them in my some DNA research
          I did years ago. This logo (top right) was what I wanted, but something about it was off. I used existing fonts to decide on the angles, and that just was not going to do. One last time I started from scratch, deciding on angles and line weights
          intentionally, and that leads us to the logo I have now.

        <p>There are many 3D printers in the NYU Makerspace. As a TA for the space a large part of my job is maintaining these machines and helping teach others how to use them. In an effort to make the space more efficient, the above status page was proposed
          and designed by me. At its core the purpose is to allow students to see the availability of printers so that they can plan their day around when they will be able to use one of the printers. I quickly realized that people in this space need
          to plan their time around another system as well, the subway. Thanks to the work of Transit Wireless the subway now has a fantastic new API that allows anyone to see when the next train will arrive. By implementing this column the status page
          was elevated from something that only a handful of people a day would find useful, to something that is useful to almost everyone that goes to NYU! As a result it was given a more prominant location in the Makerspace.

        <p>What do you do when you have a ton or cardboard and not enough light? Make a lamp out of carboard of course! I created a light using a regular icosahedron, or 20-sided figure. Inspired by D and D dice and made completely out of triangles this
          is a strong but seldom seen shape. In order to make it work better as a light, as well as make it lighter hexagons were cut out of the triangles. These same hexagons, when popped out of the shape, are used to attach the 20 faces together. This
          solution allows for the pieces to be created on different pieces of cardboard across several laser cutters simultaneously, so long as they are all standard 1/8th inch cardboard.

        <h3>Grafiti</h3>
        <p>A team and I created visualizations for Grafiti, a data visualization company based out of the Matter Accelerator here in NYC. The goal was to find innovative ways to visualize complex datasets. We chose to work with the H1B dataset, with over
          3 million lines of data from 2011 to 2016. This dataset shows, among other things, what jobs people applied for, where, and how much they were paid if they were allowed to work in US. What I created illustrates the scale of the data we were
          working with. It also shows that many workers end up at the same companies, regrardless of where in the country they were stationed.</p>
