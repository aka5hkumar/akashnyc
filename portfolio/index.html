        <h1><b>Welcome to my design portfolio.</b></h1>
        <h3> Below are a few of the best
          examples of what I have created. I do more than design though.
          All of these projects have more to them than just the design.
          Whether it was creating the backend API to produce the data or
          animating the graphics or even laser cutting what I designed to
          fabracate something real, these projects started as designs
           but have all grown into much more.<br>

        <p>My logo is a constant work in progress. When trying to come up with the initial concept I realized that whatever I created had to work across the many mediums that I work with. It doesnâ€™t matter if my logo is appearing, fully animated, at the
          end of a video or etched onto a circuit board, It needs to be truly iconic. In order to best achieve this I use simple lines. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          The first iteration (top left) was curvy. Thanks to certain TV shows I quickly grew tired of this logo. I went back to the drawing board and decided to work from the tensegrity triangle, a shape I was familiar with from creating them in my some DNA research
          I did years ago. This logo (top right) was what I wanted, but something about it was off. I used existing fonts to decide on the angles, and that just was not going to do. One last time I started from scratch, deciding on angles and line weights
          intentionally, and that leads us to the logo I have now.

        <p>There are many 3D printers in the NYU Makerspace. As a TA for a space a large part of my job is maintaining these machines and helping teach others how to use them. In an effort to make the space more efficient, the above status page was proposed
          and designed by me. At its core its purpose is to allow students to see the availability of printers so that they can plan their day around when they will be able to use one of the printers. I quickly realized that people in this space need
          to plan their time around another system as well, the subway. Thanks to the work of Transit Wireless the subway now has a fantastic new API that allows anyone to see when the next train will arrive. By implementing this column this status page
          was elevated from something that only a handful of people a day would find useful to something that is useful to almost everyone that goes to NYU! That means that it can have a more important spot in the Makerspace, perhaps even its own screen,
          rather than being a slide that comes up once every few minutes. Drawing inspiration from existing subway status pages and apps I created the status page above. It indicated everything we need to know about our printers as well as everything
          anyone cares about in the subway, how late the trains are.

        <p>What do you do when you have a ton or cardboard and not enough light? Make a lamp out of carboard of course! I created a light using a regular icosahedron, or 20-sided figure. Inspired by D and D dice and made completely out of triangles this
          is a strong but seldom seen shape. In order to make it work better as a light, as well as make it lighter hexagons were cut out of the triangles. These same hexagons, when popped out of the shape, are used to attach the 20 faces together. This
          solution allows for the pieces to be created on different pieces of cardboard across several laser cutters simultaneously, so long as they are all standard 1/8th inch cardboard.

        <h3>WORK IN PROGRESS</h3>
        <p>I am currently working on creating visualizations for Grafiti, a data visualization company based out of the Matter Accelerator here in NYC. There is more to come here! The plan is to use H1B data to illustrate what kinds of jobs people are getting
          and how these people are being compensated. This is important data, most of the data visualization class are grad students originally from outside of the county. They will soon be part of this data set, and making this data more accessible and
          easier to read will let them project what they can expect to look forward to in the coming years.
