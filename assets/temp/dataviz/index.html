    <h1>Phase One Data Visualization</h1>
    <h2>Akash Kumar</h2>
    <p>This project's purpose was to visualize the mindrider data in an interesting way.
      This was done by overlaying the data over the neighborhoods of New York City.
      This allows us to see where the highest concentrations of stressful behaviors are.
    </p>
      <p>Other benefits of this data set would be to color code the data for different stress levels,
        as well as more data on clicking on the data points.
        However, using the tools and methods that I utilized, this was not possible.</p>
